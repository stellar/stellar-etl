		Needed flags:
			TODO: determine if providing ledger sequence number or timestamp is preferable (possibly could do both)
				*: If we do both, do not require both end-time and end-ledger; only need one or the other

			start-time: the time for the beginning of the period to export; default to genesis ledger's creation time
			end-time: the time for the end of the period to export (*required)

			start-ledger: the ledger sequence number for the beginning of the export period
			end-ledger: the ledger sequence number for the end of the export range (*required)

			limit: maximum number of operations to export
				Default to 300,000 as there are 60 ledgers in a 5 minute period, each with 50 transactions, and each transaction can have up to 100 operations

			output-file: filename of the output file

		Extra flags that may be useful:
			serialize-method: the method for serialization of the output data (JSON, XDR, etc)
