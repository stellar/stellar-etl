				2b. Conversion will probably involve extracting the operations from the transactions that occurred over the time-frame

		Needed flags:
			TODO: determine if providing ledger sequence number or timestamp is preferable (possibly could do both)

			start-time: the time for the beginning of the period to export; default to genesis ledger's creation time
			end-time: the time for the end of the period to export (required)

			start-ledger: the ledger sequence number for the beginning of the export period
			end-ledger: the ledger sequence number for the end of the export range (required)

			limit: maximum number of ledgers to export; default to 60 (5 ledgers per second over our 5 minute update period)
			output-file: filename of the output file

		Extra flags that may be useful:
			serialize-method: the method for serialization of the output data (JSON, XDR, etc)
