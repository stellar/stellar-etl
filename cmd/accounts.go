		Needed flags:
			TODO: determine if providing ledger sequence number or timestamp is preferable (possibly could do both)

			start-time: the time for the beginning of the period to export; default to genesis ledger's creation time
			end-time: the time for the end of the period to export (required)

			start-ledger: the ledger sequence number for the beginning of the export period
			end-ledger: the ledger sequence number for the end of the export range (required)

			limit: maximum number of accounts to export;
				TODO: measure a good default value that ensures all accounts within a 5 minute period will be exported with a single call

			output-file: filename of the output file

		Extra flags that may be useful:
			serialize-method: the method for serialization of the output data (JSON, XDR, etc)
